# America's Next Top (Statistical) Model

This git hub repo hosts the winning submissions for America's Next Top (Statistical) Model, a DrivenData competition.

The winner used a combination of three independent predictions:
>...I used these polls to make 3 predictions. The first is just an average prediction based on the state polls. The second is a prediction based on demographics. I used regression analyses to predict state results based on demographic variables. And the third prediction is based on polls of comparable states...

>...The final prediction is based on a mixture of the three partial predictions.
